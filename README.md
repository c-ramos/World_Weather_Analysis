# World_Weather_Analysis

The app beta testers recommended adding the weather description to the weather data that I already retrieved in this module. Then, the beta testers used input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which was used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. From the list of potential travel destinations, the beta tester chose four cities to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, I created a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.

## Three techinical analyses
- Deliverable 1: Retrieve Weather Data
- Deliverable 2: Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map
- Deliverable 3: Create a Travel Itinerary Map
